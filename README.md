Wordle Game
Welcome to the Wordle Game! This is a fun word-guessing game where you need to figure out a secret five-letter word by making guesses. Each guess will be evaluated, and you will receive feedback on the correctness of your guesses. The game continues until you have guessed the correct word or run out of attempts.

Getting Started
To play the Wordle Game, follow these steps:

Clone or download the Wordle Game repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the termcolor library installed. You can install it using pip install termcolor.
Run the game script, wordle_game.py, using the Python interpreter.
Type a five-letter word and press Enter. You have six tries to guess the random word.
The script will provide feedback on your guesses, indicating correct letters in the correct position (colored green), correct letters in the wrong position (colored yellow), and incorrect letters.
Keep making guesses until you win or run out of attempts.
If you win, the script will display a congratulatory message along with the number of guesses it took to guess the word.
If you run out of attempts, the script will reveal the correct word.
